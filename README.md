# aspnetcore-web-api
I created a complete .NET Core (.NET 5) back-end with Web API, Entity Framework Core & SQL Database

I used all three types of relationships in my database: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many

I programmatically entered the data with the migrations that start with the code first

I used the methods [HttpGet], [HttpPost], [HttpPut] and [HttpDelete] to work with simple or relational data

Tested Web API with Swagger and Postman

Went through the different methods of determining the versions of the web API

Server side Sorting, Filtering and Paging

AspNet Core Web API Logging with Serilog

Unit Testing API Endpoints and Services
